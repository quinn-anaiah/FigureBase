# Figure Base To Do List



preview `Ctrl+Shift+V` 
- In new Fig Form:
    - if new category, add to category collection.(add pop infront of it before submitting). Same with materials,editions, and series
    - Make certain Fields Required
    - if retail exclusive, new attribute named store name and same for convention exclusive

- Okay so now I need to update the display fields on the collection display
    - decide on fig css and wich fields to diplay
- New Page : Wishlist display 
- Edit Fig Form: Update Doc to firestore
    - place holder/autofil current values
    - Can switch list by toggling owned
- Export to File
- Selecting a Fig on either list page should expand to provide more details

- Functional Search, searh name, series and or catgefory
    - Should poplute each results as a card with expandable . 
    - small card with Name, model number, series/catgegory, smaller card                                                     
- User Permisions
    - I should log ing
    - Only I can edit any details
    - Non users can search, view eitherlist and export
In the future i would like to expand the site to be my person one, or at least to my other collections. that sound like a good idea

Being able to upload a picture via camera, or file would be great and make the whole thing more practical
